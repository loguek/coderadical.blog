After countless domain name lapses and false starts, I've finally leapt(albeit pushed by Covid-19 boredom) and launched my blog/site upon the world. What this site will become is an unknown. Likely, I'll post yearly apologies to an unvisited site and promise to post more.

I thought long and hard about the technology that I should use. Fighting my inner-developer who says custom CMS is easy and I should build everything from scratch. This would have been particularly appealing, as it would allow me to brush up on some old friends or get acquainted with the ever-expanding army of **JavaScript Frameworks**. In the end, sensibility and Gatsby won out. It is built with performance in mind, rapid to develop and would allow me to apply some of my knowledge of **ReactJS**. The simple markup based content engine and how it uses GraphQL makes it quite versatile and perfect for my immediate needs. Building from a fork of the Gatsby blog starter, I had a working site in under an hour. Of course, this required significant restraint from diving into its inner workings and trying to improve them(i.e. break).

Another devilish temptation was design. I've always liked working on design aspects of various projects. As my experience has been mostly small teams, I've often had a strong say. The problem with this temptation is that I'm also a perfectionist. I could devote hours into what colour best represents me (#F15051), who is target audience and more importanly who will bother to read this(Thanks Mam!). So putting my managerial cap on and channelling my inner boss an MVP was pushed to live! (V2 will probably come with breaking features labelled as minor bug fixes in the release notes)
